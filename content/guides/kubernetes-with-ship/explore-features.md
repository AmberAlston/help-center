Congratulations, you're set up to iterate on your Ship application. By now you've hopefully got a good grasp on the basics of using ship, and its time to dig into the features that Ship exposes for packaging your application. 

The goal of this chapter is to help you transition into using the [Technical Deep Dives](/docs/ship) and [Reference Docs](/api/ship-yaml) as you expand your starter project into a production-ready Ship application. Topics covered are:

- [Docker Image Management and Airgap](#docker-image-management-and-airgap)
- [Deliver end-to-end Infrastructure with Terraform](#deliver-end-to-end-infrastructure-with-terraform)
- [Features for Cluster Operators](#features-for-cluster-operators)
